To unlock the full potential of **Legacy Reforged**, you'll need to pair it with a shader that supports **LabPBR**. Here are a few I recommend:

- [**Photon** by _sixthsurge_](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader)
- [**BSL** by _CaptTatsu_](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders)
- [**Complementary** by _EminGT_](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)

_(Make sure you enable any shader settings related to normalmaps, specular highlights, "Advanced Materials", etc.)_
