To unlock the full potential of **Legacy Reforged**, you'll need to pair it with a shader that supports **LabPBR**. Here are a few I recommend:

- [**Photon** by _sixthsurge_](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader)
- [**Complementary** by _EminGT_]([https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [**Bliss** by _X0nk_](https://modrinth.com/shader/bliss-shader)

_(Make sure you enable any shader settings related to normal mapping, specular mapping, "Advanced Materials", Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM), etc.)_
